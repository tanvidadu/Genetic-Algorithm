# Genetic-Algorithm

An optimal cropping pattern lets us increase profit in agriculture with minimum human efforts. The objective of this study is to formulate, simulate and evaluate a genetic algorithm-driven model to maximize crop yields and expend minimum effort. This study develops a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model and employs a genetic algorithm to optimize the stipulated objectives. I conducted experiments to compare the performance of the cropping patterns optimized by different objective functions in terms of expected fitness functions. 

# Objectives:
1. The profit made depends on cost of seeds and fertilizers and market value of the produce (both these quantities are wrt to a single plant).
2. Human efforts required for growing these crops depends upon growth periods of the plants, soil and climate suitability for growing that plant.
3. The total area for growing crops is fixed and canâ€™t exceed A (A= 100)

# Parameters considered
1. Crop Name
2. Growth Period
3. Cost Of Seed And Fertilisers
4. Market Value Of Produce
5. Human Effort
6. Climate Suitabilty
7. Soil Suitability
